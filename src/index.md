TL:DR; I met Nadiah, she was working on DataVis at the time. I loved the idea of doing something repetitively along a theme as a aide project for creativity, so I have been influenced by that. 12 months, 12 things. Although I haven't thought of a theme yet. I'm hoping one will emerge!

I remember this time last year. I had just got back from travelling around Australia. The amazing journey started with the incredible JSConfEU, where I met some _very_ inspirational people.

One of whom is the kind and talented [Nadiah Brenah](). We'd just spent an after conference speaker trip Melbourne breakfasting, zooing & winerying. When we got back into town she mentioned a projection installation they were doing in town. I mean it's me, I couldn't resist. Plus I was pretty tired by this point and we both wanted an earlyish night.

You want to build things, I want to build things and I was so frustrated last year I didn't build enough. You have to set yourself goals and objectives to do this. So this year I try. It's the same goals, one thing a month.
